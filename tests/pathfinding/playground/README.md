# Pathfinding Playground

Interactive web-based visualization tool for exploring and comparing pathfinding algorithms.

## Usage

Start the server from the project root:

```bash
# With path caching (default)
npx tsx tests/pathfinding/playground/server.ts

# Without path caching
npx tsx tests/pathfinding/playground/server.ts --no-cache
```

Then open http://localhost:5555 in your browser.

## Options

- `--no-cache` - Disable path caching in NavMesh to measure uncached performance

## Clanker Disclosure

The source code of both the UI and the backend is mostly generated by a robot and therefore probably unmaintainable by humans. Since this is meant to be one-off playground project the author has not put additional thought into the inner workings. The UI however is very highly opinionated, if you believe a clanker could do this first pass, you live in the (possibly not far off) future.
